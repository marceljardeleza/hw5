Add a README.md file to the top level of your R project (on your local computer) using Markdown
syntax and then commit the change locally and push to your GitHub repository.

For the README.md file, you can create a text file in RStudio and save it as “README.md”. 
You can then write this file using Markdown syntax (like RMarkdown, but without any code chunks).
